# Scrabble_cheat
This application uses the given letters to find words like in the scrabble board game. 
It works by counting the number of letters in a word and comparing that to the dictonary to find a match.
Example given the word "tra" the program narrows down the list of 180,000 words to words <= to the given word.
Then the letters are counted, there is 1 "t", 1 "r" and 1 "a" by comparing how many of each letter, you can find exact words
no matter the combination. Since "rat", "tar" and "art" all have the same amount of each letter they are a match.
